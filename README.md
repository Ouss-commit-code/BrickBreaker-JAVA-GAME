#Brick Breaker Game (Java)

A classic arcade-style Brick Breaker game built entirely in Java, using core object-oriented principles and Swing for rendering.
This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts including collision detection, event handling, and real-time rendering.

🎮 Game Overview
Destroy all bricks by bouncing a ball off your paddle. 
Keep the ball in play—lose all lives and the game ends. Break every brick to win!

Controls:

Left Arrow: Move paddle left
Right Arrow: Move paddle right
Space: Launch or restart ball

🧱 Core Classes (Based on Project Structure)
The game is structured into modular, reusable classes:

GameFrame.java: Main window container using JFrame.
JPanel.java: Custom drawing surface extending JPanel; handles game rendering and logic updates.
Ball.java: Manages ball position, velocity, and collision behavior.
Brick.java: Represents individual bricks with hit detection and destruction logic.
Paddle.java: Controls paddle movement and interaction with the ball.

🎨 Features
Real-time ball physics with accurate collision detection
Modular class design for easy extension
Smooth animation via javax.swing.Timer
Object-oriented architecture with encapsulated game entities
